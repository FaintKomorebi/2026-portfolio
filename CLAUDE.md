## Critical Workflow Rule

**Always `git push origin main` immediately after every `git commit`.** Chain them with `&&` in the same Bash call. The site is hosted on GitHub Pages — commits that aren't pushed don't exist for the user.

## Project Overview

**Owner:** Noah Schilling — Product Designer, Milwaukee WI (remote open)
**Repo:** https://github.com/FaintKomorebi/2026-portfolio
**Stack:** Static HTML/CSS — no build tools, no frameworks. Everything lives in inline `<style>` blocks.
**Goal:** 2026 job search portfolio targeting mid-to-senior product design / UX roles. Strategy: apply to senior roles aggressively (fewer applicants, willing to grow into it) as well as mid-level.

**Design direction:** See `FABLE_BRIEF.md` — this is the active, authoritative design brief. It is rewritten from scratch each time the direction changes; do not infer design system, colors, or type from git history or old commits.

## cs-acro.html — ACRO Automation Systems (Complete)

### Project Facts
- ACRO is a family-owned industrial automation company (90+ year history)
- Site went from 29 pages → 17 pages
- Built in WordPress, managed by ACRO's in-house SEO team post-launch
- Timeline: 6 months | Role: Lead Designer
- Competitors had 17 and 21 pages — ACRO's 29 was an outlier
- Top pages on old site: Contact Us, Careers, Automated Welding, Robotics, Automated Assembly
- Those solution pages had **no call to action** — customers found content and hit dead ends
- Brief was officially "UI refresh" but stated goals were fewer steps + solutions as main focus

### Key Outcomes
- +28% average session duration (proxy signal — engagement, not navigation)
- 1.4× CRM inquiry volume in 90 days post-launch vs. prior baseline
- Sales confirmed inquiry quality improved — prospects referencing specific solution pages

## cs-lincoln.html — Lincoln Nautilus (Not Started)

### Plan
Redesign critique of the 2024 Lincoln Nautilus infotainment / interior UI.

**Why:** Noah drove the car regularly and found the UI genuinely frustrating — specific, real reactions, not a contrived redesign exercise. Sister owns the car and visits every 2-3 weeks.

**Documentation session planned:** In-car recording session when sister visits (~2-3 weeks out). Record all screen flows, button layouts, physical control placement, every major task: navigation input, climate, audio, phone, driver settings.

### What to Capture
- Every interaction that requires eyes off road
- Every task that takes more than one tap
- Anything that gives no feedback or shows wrong state
- Physical relationship between touch controls and hardware buttons
- The moments of genuine frustration — those are the brief

### What This Case Study Needs to Show (that ACRO doesn't)
- **Product complexity** — multi-state interfaces, edge cases, error states
- **Design systems thinking** — components, states, scalability
- **Safety/constraint reasoning** — physical hardware limitations, eyes-off-road cost
- **User-centered framing** — real frustrated user (Noah), real task flows

### Pre-Session Prep
- Watch 2024 Nautilus infotainment walkthroughs on YouTube
- Write down the 3-5 specific interactions that frustrated you most (from memory)
- Check if Lincoln has updated the 2025 model — if so, frame as 2024 audit

### Framing Note
This should not be a "visual redesign." It needs to tell a systems story: broken interface, why it breaks (at the component and flow level), how to fix it. That's what gets this into senior product design conversations.

## Portfolio Strategy

**Targeting:** Mid-to-senior and senior product design / UX roles
**Approach:** Apply to senior postings aggressively — fewer applicants, and a strong candidate willing to grow is often more appealing than a safe mid-level hire

**Where ACRO works well:**
- Agencies and studios doing brand/web/marketing work
- Small to mid-size companies hiring first or second designer
- Industrial, manufacturing, B2B SaaS companies

**Where ACRO needs backup (Lincoln's job):**
- Big tech or growth-stage product companies
- Senior roles expecting product complexity, systems thinking, multi-case breadth

**Recommendation:** Start applying now to the first category while building Lincoln. Use applications as research — signal on how the portfolio lands informs what Lincoln needs to say.
